    "Kmeans is an iterative algorithm that uses the EM approach to determine the best possible clustering. Kmeans first chooses a set of k random centroids and then tries to assign each point to a cluster based on the closest distance to the centroid. Kmeans then updates the centroids by taking the mean of all the points in each cluster. This process continues until the centroids do not change in further iteration.\n",
    "Since the algorithm starts with a random set of centroids, there is no guarentee that the points will converge to a global optimum value. This is because different centroid values can lead to different results. It is possible that the initially picked centroids were very suboptimal which would then lead to suboptimal final clusters."
